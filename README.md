InterStella
===========

Emulator for the Atari 2600, in JavaScript

InterStella is a basic emulator for the Atari 2600, AKA the Video Computer System, written entirely in JavaScript and running entirely within a web browser. It's in quite early stages right now, nothing works yet, so don't get too excited.

The emulator uses several HTML 5 features, namely the canvas element, typed arrays, and the file API, so it only runs in modern browsers. I've only tested it extensively in Chrome, but any relatively recent Firefox should work, as should IE versions 10 and up.
